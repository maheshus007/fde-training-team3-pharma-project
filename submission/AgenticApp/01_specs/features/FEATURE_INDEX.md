# Feature index

One feature per file. All fourteen are authored; none has passed stage 2, so no task may be cut against a feature yet.

## Coverage check

**Fixtures.** Every public fixture maps to a feature: PUB-01/02/03 → FR-001 · PUB-04/05/06 → FR-002 · PUB-07/08 → FR-003 · PUB-09 → FR-005 · PUB-10 → FR-009 · PUB-11 → FR-005 · PUB-12 → FR-011 · PUB-13 → FR-006 · PUB-14 → FR-007 · PUB-15 → FR-010. Fifteen of fifteen.

**Azure OpenAI.** FR-013 is the **only** feature in which a model runs. Every other feature is deterministic in every mode. FR-013 writes to `human_review.annotations` and nowhere else, so the regulated fields of all fifteen fixtures are byte-identical with the model on or off (AC-FR013-01).

**Features without a fixture.** FR-004, FR-008 and FR-012 have no public fixture. Their results are reported as team-derived rather than fixture-verified, and the distinction is preserved in the coverage record. This is a limitation stated openly, not a coverage claim.

**Injects.** All 84 map to at least one feature. Dimensions and their owners: D01 → FR-005, FR-006 · D02 → FR-001, FR-004 · D03 → FR-010 · D04 → FR-001 · D05 → FR-004 · D06 → FR-002 · D07 → FR-011, FR-012 · D08 → FR-003 · D09 → FR-005 · D10 → FR-004, FR-005, FR-006 · D11 → FR-008 · D12 → FR-007 · D13 → FR-006, FR-009. The coverage CSV remains the authoritative record of *results*; this table records *ownership*.

## Corrections made when the specs were authored

Recorded so the reasoning survives.

| Change | Reason |
|---|---|
| PUB-12 moved from FR-009 to a new **FR-011** | PUB-12 reconciles LIMS v1 against v2 with an unapproved unit mapping. That is an interface-contract problem, not a continuity problem. Filing it under continuity would have produced a spec that did not match the fixture |
| **FR-012** created | Dimension D07 — IDMP identity, labelling divergence, commitment deadlines, eCTD sequence gaps, variation disputes, inspection surge — had no owning feature. The injects were mapped to test classes but no feature claimed the behaviour, so it would have been built without being specified |
| **FR-013** and **FR-014** added | Azure OpenAI became the advisory model layer and evidence gained a real store. Both are cross-cutting behaviours with their own gates, so neither could live inside an existing feature |
| Inject IDs corrected throughout | The original index cited IDs that did not match `data/injects.json`. Verified against the source: 070 is model supply-chain compromise, not shared accounts (that is 030); 081 is model substitution regression, not budget exhaustion (that is 076); 009 is omics cohort bias, not language inequity (that is 072) |
