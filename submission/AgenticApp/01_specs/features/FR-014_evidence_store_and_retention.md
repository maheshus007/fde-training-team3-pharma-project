# FR-014 — Evidence store, integrity and retention

**Question this file answers:** what is written down for every request, how it is proven unaltered, how long it is kept, and how an inspector gets it back out.

| Field | Entry |
|---|---|
| Workflow | Shared — every request in every mode writes here |
| Contract | Writes `audit{}` into all contracts; the store itself is not a contract surface |
| Fixtures | All 15 |
| Injects | 029, 035, 036, 061, 062, 069, 083, 084 |
| Principles | AP-3, AP-8, AP-9, AP-11, AP-12 |
| Owner | Architecture lead, with GxP / quality lead and the DPO role |
| Phase | 1, extended in 4 |
| Spec version | 1.0 |
| Lifecycle stage | **1 — Defined.** Awaiting stage 2 validation |
| Reviewer | Pending |

## 1. Actor and trigger

Not user-facing on write: every request writes automatically. On read, a reviewer, auditor or inspector retrieves a chain by `request_id`.

## 2. Preconditions

The store root is writable · the previous chain head is readable · retention rules and legal-hold state are readable **live**, never cached.

## 3. Happy path

1. Open a record for the request: identity, purpose, authorisation decision and inputs, mode, code version, `as_of`.
2. Record input artefacts with their SHA-256 and the copy-set manifest hash.
3. Record the emitted pack as canonical bytes with its hash.
4. In `advisory` mode, record the full model interaction and every guard outcome (FR-013).
5. Record every abstention, denial, gap and contradiction with its reason code.
6. Record reviewer actions as they occur.
7. Seal each entry with the hash of the previous entry, extending the chain.

## 4. Exceptions

| Situation | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| The store is unwritable | The request **fails closed**. An action with no evidence is not an action this system takes |
| Chain verification finds a break | Reported with the first broken link. The chain is never silently repaired or re-sealed |
| A record would contain a secret or a direct identifier | Blocked at write time by a scan, and the block is itself recorded |
| A retention period expires while a legal hold is active | Expiry is refused; the hold wins and the refusal is recorded |
| A deletion request targets held records | Restriction, not deletion, per FR-005 BR-043 |
| Cloud store unreachable in `cloud` mode | Fall back to the local chain and reconcile on restoration; never drop the record |
| An index is lost or corrupted | Rebuilt from the store. The index is derived and disposable |

## 5. Business rules

| ID | Rule | Inject |
|---|---|---|
| **BR-114** | The store is append-only and content-addressed. There is no update and no delete path other than governed retention expiry | 036 |
| **BR-115** | Each entry carries the hash of the previous entry, so alteration or removal is detectable | 029, 036 |
| **BR-116** | A request that cannot write evidence does not proceed. Evidence is a precondition, not a by-product | 029 |
| **BR-117** | The record set is identical across modes; only the destination differs. `cloud` adds platform WORM, it does not add a different design | 084 |
| **BR-118** | No database is the system of record. Any index is derived from the store and rebuildable | 084 |
| **BR-119** | LLM prompt and response records expire at **90 days** unless an evidence or legal hold applies, per `data/retention_rules.csv` | 035, 062 |
| **BR-120** | Clinical source and ICSR records are retained and are never expired by this system | 035 |
| **BR-121** | Legal-hold state is read live at expiry time and blocks expiry. It is never cached | 061 |
| **BR-122** | An expiry is itself an event in the chain, so a deletion leaves a trace | 035 |
| **BR-123** | Evidence remains readable and verifiable with every vendor integration removed | 083, 084 |
| **BR-124** | No secret, credential or direct identifier is ever written to the store; a write-time scan enforces this | 062 |

## 6. Acceptance criteria

| ID | Criterion | Verified by |
|---|---|---|
| **AC-FR014-01** | Every fixture run produces a complete chain containing request, inputs, pack, decisions and audit entries | `T-BEHAV`, all 15 |
| **AC-FR014-02** | `python -m aegis verify-evidence` passes on a clean run and reports the **first** broken link when any byte of any record is altered | `T-GATE`, INJ-036 |
| **AC-FR014-03** | Deleting one record from the middle of a chain is detected, naming the break point | `T-GATE`, INJ-029 |
| **AC-FR014-04** | A read-only store causes the request to fail closed, with no pack emitted | `T-RESIL` |
| **AC-FR014-05** | In `advisory` mode, every call stores prompt hash, rendered prompt, response, deployment, model version, `api-version`, tokens, cost, filter results and all five guard outcomes | `T-BEHAV`, FR-013 |
| **AC-FR014-06** | Scanning the whole store after a full fixture run finds zero secrets and zero direct identifiers | `T-SEC`, INJ-062 |
| **AC-FR014-07** | An LLM record older than 90 days with no hold expires, and the expiry appears as an event in the chain | `T-BEHAV`, INJ-035 |
| **AC-FR014-08** | The same record under an active legal hold does **not** expire, and the refusal is recorded | `T-GATE`, INJ-061 |
| **AC-FR014-09** | Hold state is read live at expiry; zero cache keys exist for hold or retention state | `T-SEC`, AP-9 |
| **AC-FR014-10** | Clinical source and ICSR records are never expired, proven by advancing the clock past every configured period | `T-BEHAV`, INJ-035 |
| **AC-FR014-11** | `python -m aegis evidence --request-id REQ-...` returns the complete chain, including what the model was told, in one command | `T-BEHAV`, DoD §7 |
| **AC-FR014-12** | The store is readable and verifiable with all vendor integrations uninstalled | `T-RESIL`, INJ-083, 084 |
| **AC-FR014-13** | Deleting the derived index and rebuilding it from the store reproduces it exactly | `T-RESIL` |
| **AC-FR014-14** | Record layout is byte-identical across `assessment`, `advisory` and `cloud` for the same request, excluding the model interaction that only `advisory` produces | `T-METRIC` |
| **AC-FR014-15** | In `cloud` mode the container carries a time-based immutability policy, and an overwrite attempt is rejected by the platform | `T-SEC` |

## 7. AI and human boundary

No model writes to, reads from, or influences the evidence store. Retention and hold decisions are deterministic and read live. A model may summarise a chain for a human in `advisory` mode, but the summary is annotation and the chain remains the record.

## 8. Out of scope

Being a general document management system · being a regulated records system under Part 11 or Annex 11 · e-signatures · archival beyond the declared retention periods · replacing any source system's own audit trail.

## 9. Ambiguities

None blocking. Tamper-**evidence** is claimed; tamper-**proofing** is not, because it would require infrastructure this project does not have. The distinction is stated wherever integrity is claimed.
