## Coverage summary

**177 acceptance criteria across fourteen features.** Every one is machine-checkable — none says "appropriate", "reasonable" or "as needed". Every business rule maps to at least one AC, and no AC exists without a rule behind it.

Distribution by class is deliberate rather than incidental: `T-GATE` is the largest group, because most of what this system must do correctly is refuse.

Three features — FR-004, FR-008, FR-012 — have no public fixture. Their criteria are verified against team-derived scenarios built from `data/`, and the coverage record marks them team-derived so no one mistakes them for fixture-verified results.
