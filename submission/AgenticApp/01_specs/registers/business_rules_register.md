# Business rules register

Index of every business rule across the feature specs. The rule text lives in its feature spec; this register exists so that no rule can hide, and so the gap audit can check that each one has a verifying acceptance criterion and, where relevant, a number.

## Gap audit

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Total rules | 128 across fourteen features |
| Rule with no verifying AC | None |
| Rule requiring a number but lacking one | BR-004 and BR-038 — the same back-entry materiality question, declared Unknown as AMB-11, owner GxP lead |
| AC with no rule | None |
| Rule with no inject, fixture or principle anchor | None |
| Inject cited that does not exist in `data/injects.json` | None — every ID verified against the source file |

Two rules share AMB-11 because they are the same decision seen from two features: FR-001 flags back-entry in a batch context, FR-004 flags it at the point the evidence is created. One human answer closes both.
